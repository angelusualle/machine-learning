# Machine Learning
This repository is a series of libraries, experiments around Machine Learning.

## About Machine Learning
Machine Learning is about learning useful structures from data.

In this repository we will be writing down the theory and performing experiments (perhaps also developing useful libraries)
with implementations of approaches found in literature.
